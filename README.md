# Talkspace Engineering Assessment

Thank you for your interest in the engineering position at talkspace. We are asking our applicants to take no more than 2 hours to work on this assessment.

In this assignment you will review working, but rapidly prototyped code, providing comments and some refactors to the code.

Please keep this effort time boxed to two hours and the expectation is not that the assignment is completed or solved to perfection. Please choose one or two areas to focus on refactoring and provide whatever additional comments you like as these may be used as topics of discussion for a followup engineering interview.

## Assignment:

We threw together a prototype of a simple single page app that is technically working, but needs a lot of technical work! Please pull and run the app, and review the code. There. In this little app:

- Users can create a custom robot avatar based on some configuration options
- Users can name their avatar
- Users can store their avatars to local storage
- Users can delete stored avatars.

## How to submit

**Please fork and open a PR to YOUR FORK** with your changes and in-code comments

Send us a link - Ideally the repo should have version control and have commits that outline your progress.
If you are using a private repo please allow access to the emails our recruiter provides you.

## Running the App

pull
npm install
npm run dev
